[Network]
udp_send_port=18304
[NMEA]
NMEA_ComPort=""
NMEA_ComPort_DESC=Bridge Command can emulate a GPS sending NMEA data over a serial connection. This sets the serial port name that Bridge Command should use to send emulated GPS data for use with a chart plotter, or leave blank to disable.
NMEA_UDPAddress="localhost"
NMEA_UDPAddress_DESC=Bridge Command can emulate a GPS sending NMEA data over a network connection (UDP). This sets the hostname or IP address that Bridge Command should use to send emulated GPS data for use with a chart plotter, or leave blank to disable.
NMEA_UDPPort="10119"
NMEA_UDPAddress_DESC=Bridge Command can emulate a GPS sending NMEA data over a network connection (UDP). This sets the UDP port number that Bridge Command should use to send emulated GPS data for use with a chart plotter, or leave blank to disable.
