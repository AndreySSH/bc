<h1>Bridge Command 5.0</h1>
</div>

<center>
<h2>Configuration</h2>

</center>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>Bridge Command's settings are controlled in the file bc5.ini, found in the Bridge Command root directory. Note that Bridge Command will 
look first in the user directory for a settings file, and will use this in preference to the global bc5.ini file. This allows users to change
their own settings.
The user directory is %appdata%/Bridge Command/5.0 on Windows, ~/.Bridge Command/5.0 on Linux and 
~/Library/Application Support/Bridge Command/5.0 on OSX.
</p>
<p>
The settings file can  be edited with either a standard text editor (such as notepad), or with the program provided, which can be started by 
clicking on the 'Settings: Main' button on the Bridge Command launcher.
</p>

<p>The settings control how Bridge Command runs on your screen, such as whether it runs full screen, or in a window, and at what resolution, 
as well as many other things.
</p>

<h3>Using the Settings Editor</h3>

<p>When you run the Bridge Command launcher, click the button 'Settings: Main' towards the bottom of the list. This will load an editor, as 
shown below. This allows you to read about the different settings and change them. To change a value, double click on the line you want
to change, then type the setting in the box that appears, and press enter to continue. When you have finished, clicking 'Save' at the 
bottom of the screen will save your changes and exit the editor.</p>

<!--
<h3>Special ini file options</h3>

<p>Bridge Command will normally used the file bc4.ini in the Bridge Command installation directory. However you can specify a different file if you start Bridge Command from a shortcut or the command line. If you run bc4.exe /ini="OtherIniFile.ini", you can specify a different file to load (either a full or relative path).</p>

<h3>Individual user settings</h3>

<p>In order to allow individual users to edit scenarios if they do not have write access to the location where Bridge Command is installed, an additional bc4.ini file located in %appdata%\Bridge Command\4.x (C:\Documents and Settings\USERNAME\Application Data\Bridge Command\4.x\bc4.ini for a standard installation) is used. This can override the 'scenario_dir' setting, meaning that each user can have a different scenario directory.</p>
<p>If you use the <a href="writer.html">scenario editor</a>, it will check if the current scenario directory is writable, and if not, relocate it to the user's %appdata% folder automatically.</p>

<h4>Parameters and descriptions</h4>

<p>The parameters set in the file are:
<ul>
<li>graphics_mode: 1 is full screen, 2 is windowed. 
<li>graphics_width: This sets the screen width. If running full screen, this should be a width your graphics card supports.</li>
<li>graphics_height: This sets the screen height. It should be 0.75x the graphics_width value, and should also be supported by your graphics card.</li>
<li>graphics_depth: This is the colour depth used when running full screen. It should be supported by your card, and is likely to be one of 16 or 32.</li>
<li>use_directX: This is set to 1 to use DirectX 9 if available, or 0 to use OpenGL. Depending on your graphics card, DirectX may be better supported on Windows, although at present, detailed water rendering is not available on DirectX.</li>
<li>disable_shaders: This is set to 1 to disable the shaders used for more realistic rendering of the water. You may want this on an older computer. The default is 0.</li>
<li>anti_alias: Number of pixels for anti-aliasing the rendered view, to avoid jagged pixels on sharp edges (eg where then land and sky meet). 0 to disable, default value is 4.
<li>view_angle: The angle of view for the 3d window in degrees</li>
<li>look_angle: (Optional) The initial view bearing in degrees, relative to the ship's head. If not set, this defaults to zero, i.e. looking straight ahead.</li>
<li>minimum_distance: The minimum distance in metres that is rendered by the camera. If this is too small, you will see strange depth artifacts.</li> 
<li>maximum_distance: The maximum distance the camera will render in metres. If the visiblity is less than this, the smaller value will be used.</li>
<li>Joystick settings: <a href="joystick.html">Please see the Joystick documentation</a></li>
<li>udp_send_port: The port used by Bridge Command to send UDP data when being used with the Map Controller or multiple displays.</li>
<li>NMEA_ComPort: Sets the serial port number that Bridge Command should use to send emulated GPS data for use with a chart plotter, or 0 to disable.</li>
</ul>
