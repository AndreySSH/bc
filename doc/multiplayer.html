<h1>Bridge Command Multiplayer Documentation<br />EXPERIMENTAL</h1>
</div>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Bridge Command can be used in a multiplayer mode, where multiple users can control vessels in the same scenario, and interact. This mode is intended for users on a single network (wired or wireless), but could be used over the internet.</p>

<p>This feature is currently very experimental. Please provide feedback and suggestions for developments.</p>

<h2>Starting a multiplayer session</h2>

<p>You will need to run one 'Multiplayer server' for each session. This can run on a dedicated computer, or on the same computer as one of the Bridge Command sessions.</p>

<p>
To start a multiplayer session, start the server, and make a note of the computer name (MINI in the example below).
</p>

<p>
Then each user should start Bridge Command on their own computer, and select a multiplayer scenario. Each user will need the same scenario, and to select the 'Networked' option below the scenario list. To distribute a scenario, you can use the 'Export scenario' and 'Import scenario' options on the scenario selection screen.
</p>
<p>
If you want to make a new multiplayer scenario, you can use the scenario editor to do this, selecting the 'Multiplayer' option instead of selecting the own ship model. Each 'controlled ship' will become the own ship for each user, so the first controlled ship will be the own ship for the first user.
</p>

<p>
When you have selected the scenario (with the 'Networked (main)' option selected), you will be asked to enter the name or IP address of the multiplayer server. Type this in as shown ('MINI' in this case) and press enter to continue. You will then be asked to enter which ship number you want to be. This should be between 1 and the total number of multiplayer ships (defined as controlled ships in the scenario). Each user will be accepted in turn by the server, so once user 2 has joined, user 3 will join the simulation.
</p>

<p>
The simulator running the first ship sets the simulation time, and the time in the other simulations will be adjusted to keep in sync. You should not use the 'accelerator' modes in multiplayer mode. The first simulator also sets the weater conditions, which are replicated in all other simulations.
</p>

<h2>Technical information</h2>

<p>
Bridge Command and the multiplayer server use the UDP protocol, and by default uses ports 18303 and 18304. For more information on the networking protocol, see the <a href="networkprotocol.html">networking protocol</a> information. The multiplayer server uses the 'MC' message, and the clients use the 'BC' message.
