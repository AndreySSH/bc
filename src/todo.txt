Notes:
------
Will need to apply tidal stream by modifying drag in ahead/lateral directions, instead of as a simple offset when the own ship is moved!

Terrain related:
----------------
Load from heightmap image into a 2d vector, of size (2^n + 1) square
Pass this to the terrain loader.

Apply same to load from a non-square binary file. Extend this to non-floating point binary.

Change checking of heights, so it returns the maximum height, not the height from the maximum number terrain.

Use ray intersection to get 'heightmap' for 3d models that have been loaded and scaled. Use these for radar.
