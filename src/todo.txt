Notes:
------
Will need to apply tidal stream by modifying drag in ahead/lateral directions, instead of as a simple offset when the own ship is moved!

Terrain related:
----------------
Load from heightmap image into a 2d vector, of size (2^n + 1) square
Pass this to the terrain loader.

Apply same to load from a non-square binary file. Extend this to non-floating point binary.

When terrain is stable, move back into CTerrainSceneNode (in Irrlicht) for speed boost
