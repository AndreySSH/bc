Notes:
------
Will need to apply tidal stream by modifying drag in ahead/lateral directions, instead of as a simple offset when the own ship is moved!

Terrain related:
----------------
When terrain is stable, move back into CTerrainSceneNode (in Irrlicht) for speed boost (Probably not needed with better build options)
