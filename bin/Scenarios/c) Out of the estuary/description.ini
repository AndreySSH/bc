On board VIC 56, an eighty-five foot steam ship, built in 1945 as part of the wartime ship building program

VIC 56 is now preserved in working order in Portsmouth at Boathouse 4. For more information, please visit www.vic56.co.uk.

Can you avoid the other river traffic, while steaming to the mouth of the estuary, and staying in the buoyed channel?
